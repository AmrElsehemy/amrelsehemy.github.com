          <p>"I believe this is a very good tool not only for students to put together their own collection of resources to examine in detail  a specific topic, but it can also be a useful tool for teachers to assemble a  variety of content on a topic to share with students to help them learn a  topic. Either way, this tool uses some of the most powerful learning  perspectives such as constructionism, collaboration and&nbsp;lifelong learning</p>
            
          <p>As a constructionist tool, Binders takes advantage of many online information resources to allow learners to fully examine a particular topic. Binders also uses some of the most well known resources to assist learners in finding relevant content. One information literacy is locating relevant content and Binders assists with this skill. By limiting initial resources to Binders well chosen resources, the learner is also assisted with the information literacy skill of evaluating the resource. Students create the resources necessary to learn a specific topic and they are supported, or scaffolded, as they engage in the process. This is a very good tool for constructionist learning.</p>  
         
         <p>There is also an element of collaboration in the design of Binders. Students can build and share binders. This can allow students to engage in conversations about the content. These conversations can enhance the students' understanding. They can also work on enhancing each others' resources and improve upon the contents of the binders.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, the Binders allow the content to continually be updated. So, students can learn the topic, but also be updated continually as knowledge on the topic continues to evolve. As students graduate and move into the work force, they can return to these topics as needed and see what has changed in that particular area.  In the end, I see the Binders being useful for creating a sort of primer for a particular topic or a repository that can be used sort of like an annotated bibliography with live links to the resources.  It will be useful learning, sharing, and storing content that students are learning.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><strong>Students</strong><br />
I like that you have pre-chosen the web resources to link to, but I think that there are some others that informational and instructional that might also be included. the functionality of constraining the content to the elements that are relevant to the learner is a very good idea and having other content that is constantly updated will make these binders be a useful tool for lifelong learning.  The fact that they can also write their own connective comments also suggests that this tool would align quite well with a constructionist perspective to learning. The core idea of constructionism is that students learn by building something. The extent to which the students are actively engaged in the content they are creating is a primary factor in their ability to learn. In addition, there is a social dimension to the constructionist perspective.  Keep these two ideas in mind in your development -- Active engagement in the content and social interactions with the sharing of content.</p>

         <p>For active engagement, it is important to not just read what you are putting into the binder. If you are basically copying and pasting a url, you are not really actively engaged. The tool you proposed to constrain say a Wikipedia article to the relevant content, does require the active engagement. Writing connective narrative to tie together two web resources or explaining the value of a web resource are all examples of active engagement. The more that the students do something with the content, the more learning will take place.</p>
         
         <p>As for the social dimension of learning, is is not enough to simply share binders. There needs to be an opportunity for the designer to engage in a conversation with the receiver of the content. In this way, as the receiver struggles to understand the contents of the binder, the designer must articulate the contents. This type of exchange again, suggests a more active engagement in the content and will result in better learning of the content. The extent to which you can allow this type of communication between designer and receiver, can result in a more powerful tool for learning.</p>
                   <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><strong>Teachers</strong><br />
Teachers can also use the binders to assemble content for a course (a collection of binders might be a course where a single binder might be a topic in a course).  If you can conceive of a way for teachers to use the Binders, you again, may have a more useful tool for learning. There are at least two ideas that are suggested if you take this perspective. One is that you may want to expand the default web services to more informational and instructional, and the other is the idea of creating framework binder that can be distributed to a group of students that can learn some things from the existing contents and can add stuff to the binder to expand the coverage and this binder can be shared back to the teacher.
</p>
         <p>Some of the additional websites that come to mind include: <br />
The Khan Academy -- http://www.khanacademy.org/<br />
The OER Commons -- http://www.oercommons.org/<br />
FREE -- http://free.ed.gov/<br />
I am sure that there are others, but those are some very popular and free sites for educational resources, rather than just informational resources.  Also, I see that you included Pintrest. I have begun to use Pearltrees as my bookmarking site because it organizes my links in a conceptual model. You might consider adding it as well.</p>


         <p>Finally, if you can setup a one-many and many-one sharing system, then the teacher can share their binder with a group of students and that group of students can build out further details and share it back to the teacher. There needs to be both a mechanism for sharing and a mechanism for communication to make this work. Finally, whatever is shared, needs to be "editable" by the student so they can make it their own and will be able to use it as a constructionist tool as described above.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, I see your project as an exciting one. I think that it can become an exciting and useful tool for learning. I look forward to see the further developments."</p>
